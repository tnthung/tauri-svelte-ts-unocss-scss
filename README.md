# Brief

This is a template for creating the app with following tech-stack:
`Tauri`, `SvelteKit`, `Typescript`, `UnoCss`, `Scss`.
With this, you'll have a minimum clean skeleton with no boilerplate
code.


# Usage

```sh
# clone the repo with one of following command
git clone https://github.com/tnthung/tauri-svelte-ts-unocss-scss.git
gh repo clone tnthung/tauri-svelte-ts-unocss-scss

# Then run (I'm using PNPM, other pm should be fine)
cd tauri-svelte-ts-unocss-scss
rm -rf .git
pnpm i
pnpm tauri dev
```

After all command ran, you should see a 800x600 window with only
white background.
